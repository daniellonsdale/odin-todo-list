# TOP Todo List
The Todo List project from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list. I want to practice webpack, using modules, separating logic from DOM manipulation, localStorage, and CSS.

Reflections:
- I had a lot of trouble handling the different object using modules, and ended up putting way too much in index.js
- As much as I tried, the code is a bit messy and likely doesn't follow best OOP principles
- Using localStorage to rehydrate methods proved very difficult, but it forced me to really think and research
- I ended up limiting functionality (sorting) since I had spent so much time on this project
- Ultimately, I think the final product is decent and I'm excited to try again after learning more advanced methods to make a better todo list website (databases, React, typescript, tailwind, etc.)
